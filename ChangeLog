		Started implementing changes on naming conventions (susp vs. s) and capitalization of function arguments. Started tweaking the manuals by adding \code{} and \emph{} where applicable. This effort is still ongoing and has not been conducted codewide. 
		* getPPP (getPercentilePlottingPositions.r): Made getPPP the primary function and getPercentilePlottingPositions the secondary, to
		prevent problems and excessive typing during debugging. Added na.rm argument. getPPP now can return the event vector.
		*pivotalMC(pivotalMC.r): removed argument 'event', added support for event columns in the 'x' argument
