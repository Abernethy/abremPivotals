		Am attempting to implement a test branch in which reconciliation will be attempted with abrem.  This package branch is intended 
		to be used with functions built in abremTest to demonstrate interactions in functions related to original abrem functions.
		The first of these test pairs will be a restoration of getPPP to its original intended form (with some new argument labels).
		The abremTest function to first be attempted will be linear_event_frame a replacement for params.to.ob (Not linearPPP, since the 
		output of params.to.ob would not be suitable for sending to lslr directly.)

		Started implementing changes on naming conventions (susp vs. s) and capitalization of function arguments. Started tweaking the manuals by adding \code{} and \emph{} where applicable. This effort is still ongoing and has not been conducted codewide. 
		* getPPP (getPercentilePlottingPositions.r): Made getPPP the primary function and getPercentilePlottingPositions the secondary, to
		prevent problems and excessive typing during debugging. Added na.rm argument. getPPP now can return the event vector.
		*pivotalMC(pivotalMC.r): removed argument 'event', added support for event columns in the 'x' argument
